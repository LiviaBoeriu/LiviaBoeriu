# Hello, I am Liv!

:bulb: Full-stack developer with a deep love for all things Javascript

:mortar_board: With a master's in IT Design and Application Development

:mag: Always seeking opportunities to expand on my skills <br/><br/>



ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Recipe Box](https://github.com/LiviaBoeriu/RecipeBox)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js <br/><br/>


I am currently looking for the right place to start my professional IT journey, preferably someplace around Aalborg, Denmark or remote. If you want to get a more in-depth view of my past projects you can check out my [ portfolio ](https://liviaboeriu.com). <br/><br/>


âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing video games and when I'm not at the computer I am probably attempting to convince my friends to play some boardgames. Nothing beats bonding over who cheated at Monopoly!
